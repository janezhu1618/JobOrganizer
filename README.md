# JobOrganizer
An app that allows users to create, save, and update information about a job posting that they responded to, and share interview tips, dress code, and common interview questions.

# Introduction
Programmers and mobile developers may send out hundreds of job applications before they land a job.  With numerous applications, it becomes difficult to keep track of the details of each job as well as which ones actually offered an interview.  JobOrganizer is a tool built to help people with their job search journey.  The app enables users to record details about a job posting, such as the application phase they are currently in, the URL that they found the job positing from, and the contact information of the recruiter or interviewer.  It is also a platform for job seeks to share information about job hunting in general.  There are message boards where users can discuss interview attire, common interview questions, and tips to ace interviews.
